# HikPasswordHelper
A tool which exploits a backdoor in Hikvision camera firmwares circa 2014-2016 ([ICSA-17-124-01](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Sep/23)) to help the owner change a forgotten password.

## Usage

Download [`HikvisionPasswordResetHelper.exe` from the releases tab](https://github.com/bp2008/HikPasswordHelper/releases) and run the exe.

There are 5 simple steps to reset a password, and you can even skip steps 3 and 4 in many cases.

## Requirements

.NET Framework 4.5.2 - This is included in any modern Windows installation.

A Hikvision device that is vulnerable to [ICSA-17-124-01](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Sep/23).

Here is an *incomplete* list of camera firmwares that have been reported to be vulnerable or not.  This list is compiled from various sources and the camera models are unspecified.  [Some camera models are reportedly vulnerable at different ranges of firmware versions](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-17-124-01), so I would not put complete faith in the accuracy of this list for all camera models.

If your firmware is too old to use this method to reset a lost password, you can try the reset code method:

If your firmware is too new, then I'm afraid you are out of luck because the reset code method won't work either.
